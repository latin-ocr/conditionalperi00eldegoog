Priem, Philol. Supplevit V, 2 (1885), p. 297-‚ even maintains
that the past tenses of the Indicative may, exceptionally, express
unreality.

In reference to the Present subjunctive in conditione Madvig, Lat.
Orata. §347‚ b, says: “The Present Subjunctive is employed when
a condition thetis still possible is assumed as occurring now or at
some future time, while it is at the same time intimated that it will not
actually occur.'’

Others, (cf. Sonnenschein‚ 0. R. Vol. Ι, p. 124), deny that the
Present subjunctive implies the possibility of the occurrence of the
supposed case.

Gildersleeve, Lat. Orant. ἐξ oso-599, makes three divisions which
he calls ‘⁶ Logical‚ ldeal‚ Unreal.''

Allen and Greenough, Lat. Grom. §305‚ following tlre example of
Goodwin in his classification of Greek conditional sentences, take the
connotation of time as the basis of their classification and recognize
three classes, which virtually amount to four, as Future Conditions are
subdivided into More or Less Vivid Conditions, expressed respectively
by a future tense of the Indicative‚ or by the Prescnt or Perfect Sub-
Junctive. ’

Bayfield, 0. R. Vol. I V, pp. too-202, advocates a similar classid-

cation‚ aud argues against the contrary to fact implication of the past
tenses of the Subjnnctive.

C. TWO CLASSES.

Sonnenschein‚ Lat. Orant. ξ 353, assigns conditional sentences to

two main classes in accordance with a theory which he states in O. R.
Vol. I. pp. 238-239.
1). Class A. “'l'hose in which the lf=clause does not imply any-
thing as to the fact, or fulfilment of the condition (Open condition),
and the Principal clause does not speak of what would be or troald have
been. The If=clause takes the Indicative.”

d). Class B. “Those in which the If-clause implies a negative
(Rejected condition), and the Principal clause speaks of what would
be or would have been. The Subjunctive in both clauses.’'

To these two main divisions he adds a third class, Olass O, other·
wise resembling Class A, but in which the Subjunctive is used in the
If=clause‚ instead ol the Indicative‚ to mark an action as merely con·
ceived, contomplated‚ or in prospect.
