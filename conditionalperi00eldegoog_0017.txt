Roby‚ Lot. Grom. ἓ 5 loss-1551, also distinguishes two moin
classes:
l). “In the lndicotive or Irnperative mood, a condition is put simply
without its being implied that it does, or does not, occnr.''
2). “A conditional subjunctive expresses an action, whose non-
occurrence is implied‚ but which is supposed to occur os the condition
of another supposed action.''

Finally‚ Ianne, Lat. Grato. §52022-2024, divides conditional sen·
teucos into two classes:
l). Indeterminste Protases‚ i. e. such as merely suppose an action,
without irnplying either its occurrence or non-occurrence. These are
subdivided into:
a). Iudicat-ive Use; any tense of the Indicative required by the sense,'
h). Subjunctive Use; Prosent Subjunctive‚ less frequently the Perfeet
Subjunctive.
2). Protases of Action Non-Occurrent, i. e. such as suppose action
not taking place. lrnperfect or Pluperfect Subjunctive.

The whole Period‚ like the Protesis, is either an Indeterminate
Period‚ or a Period of Action Non-Occurrent.
