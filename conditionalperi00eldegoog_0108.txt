Epist. Ι, 2, 37·39
« Nam cur,
quae laedunt oculum, festinas demere: siquid

est animum, differe curandi tempus in annum?

Α conditional idea is implied in the first clause to which the condi·
tion introduced by si is opposed.

c). In Epod. l, 5-6 the second condition is introduced by si
contra. ι

In Serm. ΙΙ, 3, 74-76 contra alone, with omission of conditional
particle, follows the preceding condition.

B. Si forte. si Modo, etc.

127). St, early set, is a Locative particle, primitive form *soa-i. For
the origin of its use as a conjunction cf. Bennett, Lat. Grom. App. 5
394. stc is formed from si by the addition of the enclitic c( ).

The force of si is more precisely determined by the use of various
particles as simodo, st' tomen, sifortc, etc.

128). SI FORTE. Forte isan adverbial Ablative (orInstrumentel,
Bennett, Lat. Grani. App. ξ 257, 3) of the Nominative fors, and
when used in combination with si adds an clement of regnaness or
uncertainty to the condition : ‘isperltopa’ ‘if ltaply.' St‘fortc frequent·
ly occurs in tlte Satires and Epistles, it is not found in the Odes or
Epodes. ·

one or more words. ⁴
