Verhs of emotion are commonly constr-ned with a causal clause intro·
duced by quod (sometimes puio or cunt. cf. Lane, Iaut. Grnm. δ 1851),
or with an Accusatire with an Infinitive. Occasionally verbs os thie
class are found in connection with a Conditional Protesis introduced
hy si (rarely nior ruhi). In such cases si retains, to a greater or lete
extent, its conditional character and ia not to he considered as a purely
oausal particle.

classical Latin. cf. Driiger. [stet. Synt. l'ol. ΙΙ, pp. 734735.
