INTRODUCTION.

4). anue oi the Historicsl Method oi syntecticsl Treutment.

The study of tlre use of a particular syntactical construction by in·
dividual authors, or of the employment of a certain construction
throughout the whole ol Latin literature, bas a threefold value. Not
only does it furnish a basis for the scientific criticism aud emendation
ol the text of the individual writer, bnt als0, from an examinatior} and
comparison of the results obtained in the case of single authors, we are
enabled to darive much information as to the origin aud development
of a construction and to estahlish a fixed standard of grammatical usage
for the lauguage as a whole.

5). Clmiiication of Conditionsl Sentences.

A complete history of the conditional sentence in Latin would throw
much light upon the vexcd question as to the proper system of classili·
catiou of such sentences. Many and conflicting views have been held.

Liebig: Dic hypothetiscbca Sane bei Terent, Gtrltrz, 1863, pp. 3-4,
gives a summary oi the methods followed prior to the appearance oi
his monograph.

The traditional method of classification recognizes three classes ac·
cording to the varying degrees of reality, of possibility, of probability,
or of uureality implied in the condition; but there is a wide divergeucy
of opinion among grammarians as to what the true implication of the
various forms really is.²

Another clement is introduced by those who make a distinction as to
whether the possibility of the occurrence of a supposed case is to be
thought ol' as objective or subjective. '

1For the literature on the Historical Syntax of the Latin lauguage cf.
Schmalz, Lat. Gram. pp. 202-213, Dritte Aqunge, 1900.

At present the most comprehensive work dealing with Latin syntax
along historical lines is Driz'ger’s Histordsclre Syntax der lateiniscden
Spraclre‚ Leipzig, 1878-81. Although of great value, it is however by no
means complete nor exhaustive.

Classical Reoiew referred to in θ 1.
