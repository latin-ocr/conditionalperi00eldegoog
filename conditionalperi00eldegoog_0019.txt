7). Α Conditional Pcriod is a complete sentence consisting of two
parts, expressed or implied3 the Protesis, or subordinate clause, con·
tainiug the condition and the Apodosis, or principel clause, containing
the conclusion,

The Protesis is usually, although not necessarily, introduced by a

conditional particle, us ri, uisi, oi. (For Protases introduced hy sice
cf. Chap. v).
8). The conditional Period is an evolution from an early paratactio
stage of lenguage, in which there was au absence ol subordinate clauses
and sentences, containing each a thought complete in and of itself, were
placed in juxtaposition without connecting liuks, e. g. habet, dot; hc
hos, he pines.

Now we ceu scarcely conceive of such e juxtapositioo in which the
clauses are absolutely independent of each other. The very fact that
they are thus placed together implies a connection in thought between
them.1

As language became more highly developed, this logical relation
gradually came to be expressed by means ol particlcs, and we pass
from Paretexis, or Cobrdination, to Hypetaxis, or Subordination.
Thus, taking the example quoted above, habet, dut ,· hc hos, he pines,
when it is clear from the connection that the first sentence denotes an

assumption, and is related to the second sentence as condition to conse· ,

quence, this relation is expressed by ei, and we heve ei habet, dot ; if
he hcc, hc pices.
ln sentences like si habeut, det, the thjouctive of the Protesis was

“Pure Paratonio, i. e. where instead of one sentence determining the
other, the two reciprocally determine each other, existe only between
parallel sentences, whether the thoughts conjoined be of analogous or con-
trary import3 e. g ‘he is blind, she is deaf,·’ ‘he leuglrs, she cries.’ ’'
