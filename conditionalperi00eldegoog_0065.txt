43). In sentences introduced byei, with the verb in the Imperfect or
Pluperl'ect, expressing repeated action, “es osten aa‚” “every time
that‚’' or action taking place at no definite time, the Indicative is used
in early Latin.

Placet. Aa. 143. Atque ea st' earet, mayenne habebas dis pretium.
Aul. 427. Bacch. 426.

Caesar, Cicero and Sallust generally use the indicative, rarely the
Subjunctive.

Caes. B. 0. ΠΙ, 110, 4. Si quis prehenderetur, consensu militurn

' eripiebatur.

Sall. Iup. 58, 3. sin Numidae propius accessissent ibi virtutem osten·
dere.

darell. 84, 1. Chommoda dicebat, si qrtundo commodo uellet dicere
Arrius.

ln Livy and Tacitus the subjunctive is of frequent occurrence,
Suetonius uses it almost exclusively. In late Latin both ludicative
and subjunctive are used, one about as often as the other.

In two instances in sentences introduced by si, Horace uses the
Imperfect Subjunctive in the Protesis of a Genernl Past condition*
with the Imperfect Indicative in the Apodosis. '
