34). An indeterminate Subjnnctive Period is occasionally identical
in l'orm with a Period ol Action Non-Occurrent. This takes place
when a future subjunctive condition is transferred to the past, becom-
ing relatively future, i. e. denoting future action from the standpoint
nithe past. The Present subjunctive is then replaced hythe Imper-
fect subjunctive, the Perfect by the Pluperfect.

This transiereuce occurs only when the context clearly shows that
past action is supposed. The tense of the Snbjunctive does not imply
that the condition is contrary to fact3 the supposition may, or may not,

have been fulfilled.
