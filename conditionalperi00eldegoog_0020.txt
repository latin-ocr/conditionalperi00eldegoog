originally dussire, that of the Apodosis the so·called Potential.1 In its
early paratactic t‘orm the sentence would bave been lrabeat, det, let him
boue (i. e. ussaruiap ire should have), te toould give.

Conditioual Perinde of Action Non-Occurrent of the type si baberet-
doret‚ probably had their origin in a shifting of tenses which took place
early in the history of the language. Originally the Present Subjunc·
tire was used iu present conditione contrary to fact, ² as well as in Iu·
determinate Periods3 and tho Imperfect Subjunctive was employed
merely as a Potential of the past. Gradually‚ for the sake of clear·
neas, the Imperfect took the place of the Present in contrary to lact
conditious in present time, aud the Pluperfect replaced the Imperfect.
Thus both the Imperr'ect aud the Pluperfeet subjunctive carue to have
a notion ot' unreality which originally did not belong to them, aud the
Present subjunctive was confined to the sphera of the potential. (cf.
Solemnis, Lat. Graue. ξ 338.) g

Bennett, Lot. (irum App. ξ 396, thinks that the Protasis iu seu-
tences of this type may originally hare been an Optative‚ i. e. ei adesset,
bene esset; lit. “ O that be ruere berei it would be well.’'

9). An Indeterminate Period is a conditional period in which the
Protasis merely supposes au action, without implying that it does, or
does not, occur.

Indeterminate Per-iods may be divided into two classes:

1. Any tense of the Iudicative in the Protasis, the mood and tense of
the Apodosis being determined by the sense.

2. The Present or Perfect Subjunetive iu the Protasis, the Apodosis
usually in the Present Subjunctive.

'l'be following combinatione with au Indicative Protasis occur in
Horace:

Ι. Protasis in the ment lndieative.

10). l. Apodosis in the Present Indieative.

'ruis combination is cornmon iu all periods of the languagc.

¹Proiessor Hele calls the subjunctive iu the Apodosis ot sentences ol
this type the ‘⁴ subjunctive ot Ideal Certainty,” Professor Bennett the
‘¹ Subjunctive ot Contingent Futurity.” Various other uses of the Inde-
pendent subjunctive are also found in the Apodosis of sentences of this
class.

ernis usage is attested from Plautus and is occasionally found later in
poe-try as an archaism.
