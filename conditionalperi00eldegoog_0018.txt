6). Enough has been said to show the existing state of uncertainty
as to the classihcation ol tlte conditional sentence, and ιο emphasize
the need ol'a tltorough treatment from the historical point of view.

'l'hus iar, Blase's Geeoltt'oltte dee Irrculie ira Luteinlsehen, Erlanpen,
1888, is the only work, covering any considerable part ol the ground,
that is based on historic principles. As regards the other forms this
work still remains to be done, although valuable contributione ιο the
subject have been made in various articles and monographs, and the
use os the conditional Sentenoe in the case ol individual poete and
prose writers has been carefully dealt with by different scholare.

In regard ιο the conditional Sentence, Moeris, in his review of
Lene’s Grammar, A. J. P. Vol. XX, pp. 320-328, says in substance:
1t we suppose that the essential characteristic of conditional sentences
is the implication ol' reality, probability, possibility and their opposites,
we must also allow that certain other characteristics, as time, generali·
zation, vivirlness, emotion, although incidental, may have a greater or
lesa influence upon this implication. Still other elementa, too, as the
person and rueaning ol the verb, and the presence of certain adver-bs,
seem, in certain cases, to have an effect upon the meaning implied in
the condition, although at present hardly anything is known in regard
to tha force cf these forms.

Until a complete history ol the conditional Sentence throughout
Latin literature hasbeen written, such as shall trace its development
from the earliest times to the latest, many points which ure now a
matter ol doubt rnnst necessarily remain obscure.

In view of these cnrrsiderations we must conclude with Prof. llIorris,
thet Lane's system of classifioatinn both sets aside all elassifiration
based upon occidental characteristica, and attha same time lays the
only possible basia lor the observation of the elements which may have
an influence upon the meaning implied in the condition.

‘l'his metlnnl, then, l have, iu the main, adopted in my classiflcation .

of the conditional Sentence in the writings of Horace. 1 have, in
most instanoes, followed tlte text of Keller and Holder, although Ihave
not hesitated to depart srom it in certain ceses, especially where these
editors seem to have allowed too little weight to the authority of the
Blandinian manuscripts.
