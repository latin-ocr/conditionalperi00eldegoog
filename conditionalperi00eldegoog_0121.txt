Parataxis.

147). There remain those cases in which sentences are expressed as
independent and coordinate, instead of being subordinated one to the
other by means of conditional partiales.

This usage is not to be explained by the omission of si, but is a sur·
vival from the early paratactic stage ol language which was character·
ized hy the absence of connecting partiales, and where sentences of
different syntactic value were placed side by side, leaving it to the
hearer to infer the logical connection between them. cf. ἕ 8.

Kiihner, Lat. (iram. ἓ 178, distinguishes two varietiesof Parataxis:

l. Rhetorical, or Artistic, used to give aparticular effect, and
occurring with greater or less frequeney throughout Latin literature.

2. Natural, arising from an ease or carelessness in the expression
of thought3 found most ollen in authors who employ the colloquial
style in their writings, as in the Comic Poets, especially Plautus, in
the Satires and Epistlcs of Horace, in the Satires ol Juvenal, and in
the philosophical dialogues and the letters of Cicero.

This co-ordinate structure occurs in the writings of Horace in all
moods and tenses, except the Imperfect Indicative.
